Jupyter and tip and tricks
==========================

Text cell becomes weird
-----------------------

If you click on a cell, you can see some weird stuff, that is raw markdown code.  
Don't worry,it is just the geek way of doing formatted text, you just need to execute the cell to get it back to normal.

Auto-completion
---------------

You can use the TAB keypad to use auto-completion. It is not magical, jupyter needs to know what is the type of the variable to use it,but it will propose you all the methods available for that object.

When using google colab, you can use CTRL+SPACE

Stackoverflow
-------------

Stack overflow is the number 1 general resource for developper. There are a lot of joke about software developpers spending a lot of time copy-pasting stuff from this site.  
It is great, and you will find most of your answer here, if you can formule the right question.
